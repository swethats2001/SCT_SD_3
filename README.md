About the Internship
--------------------
As a Software Development Intern at Skillcraft Technology, Iâ€™m working on real-world projects and building practical skills in software development. This repository contains the completed task, along with code documentation and explanations.

Task 3:Sudoku Solver
-----------------------

This Python program solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles automatically using a backtracking algorithm. It takes an unsolved puzzle in grid format and fills in all empty cells according to standard Sudoku rules, ensuring each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid.

**Features**
- Automatic Puzzle Solving: Solves any standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle efficiently.
- Simple Display: Prints the unsolved and solved puzzle grids, with empty cells shown as dots (".") for better readability.
- 
**Usage**
1. Define your Sudoku puzzle as a 9x9 grid with `0` representing empty cells.
2. Run the program to see the puzzle solution printed in a readable format.

This program is ideal for exploring the basics of backtracking algorithms and understanding Sudoku solutions.
